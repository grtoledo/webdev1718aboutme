     The Science Achievers Program is a free program offered to teens 14 and older by the <a href="http://www.msichicago.org/press/general-museum-information/imagery-and-videos/"> Museum of Science and Industry</a> (MSI). It is program done throught the school year and it has 3 different seessions. The fall session, winter session and spring session, most Science Achievers will go to all three sesssions but some opt out of a session do to a sport, tutoring or any other reason.

    To become a Science Achiever you first have to go through the Science Minors program. You can apply to be Science Minor <a href="http://www.msichicago.org/education/out-of-school-time/science-minors/">here</a> or on the MSI's website. The Science Minors program is similar to Science Achivers but there are differences. Both Minors and Achivers take place every Saturday for 10 weeks. Minors takes place in the morining for about 3 hours from 9am to noon. Achievers takes place all day from 9am to 4pm with an hour lunch break at noon.

     At the end of every Minor session there is a family day. The museum provides food and the Minors will showcase what they learned to family and friends. Achievers on the other hand have a Case Celebration at the end of the year in the spring. Here we showcase what we learned throughout the year and celebrate the Senior graduating. The Seniors are given a gift and in recent years it has usually been a laptop.

  In the image above, I know all three. The girl only by face because her last year in the program was my first year. What I do know about her is that she goes to <a href="www.purdue.edu/">Purdue</a> with a scholarship that pays for most of her schooling. The male on the left is named Cornelious and he goes to <a href="https://www.brown.edu/">Brown University</a>. The male on the right is named Alan and he has a full-ride scholarship to <a href="https://www.stanford.edu/">Stanford</a> to study neuroscience and surgery.

    I didn't interact much with Alan and the girl beacuase they always chose the T.E.S.L.A. session. T.E.S.L.A. stands for Teens Exploring Scince with a Live Audience. This is an actual show that air live on TV. With Cornelious I have had many sessions with him including the Chemistry of Tye-Dying two years ago and the Material Science of Math last year.

    This session, we are having the Chemistry behind Black and White Photography, T.E.S.L.A., I-Stan and Media.<a href = "http://www.msichicago.org/explore/whats-here/exhibits/you-the-experience/the-exhibit/istan/"> I-Stan</a> is a session about medicine. Media is a new session that is being done, in which we will be creating a Youtube channel.
