        I enjoyed Harry Potter because there so much character and different possiblities that could happen. It gets me wondering what if Harry did something different in one of the books, how would it change it. My favorite character in the book is Harry, not just because he's the protagonist but also because you can relate to life from his schooling to having that annoying cousin.

        Warriors is a series of books about wild cats who live in a forest. I enjoy it because the authors <a href="http://www.warriorcats.com/meet-erin-hunter/">Erin Hunter</a> wrote these book with the cats belonging to different clans like Native Americans belong to different tribes. It tells the life of cats and thier problems. In the first set of the series, the main problem is the destruction of their forest because of twolegs (humans) and how they are looking for solutions to save their home. I won't say what happend for those who decided to read the books. Fun Fact, Erin Hunter is actually six different people.

        The Inheritance Cycle is about the a young man named Eragon who finds a mysterious stone in the mountains near his village. The mountians could be like the Forbidden Forest from Harry Potter or the <a href ="http://naruto.wikia.com/wiki/Forty-Fourth_Training_Ground"> Forest of Death from Naruto</a>. The king has sent creatures after Eragon searching for the stone, which hatches into a dragon. The King is a tyrant who was once part of the Order of Dragon Riders. The King rebelled against the Order and killed almost every single dragon rider. Now Eragon must travel to the Vale to find the rebellions who want to overthrow the king and fight alongside them. All while learning his new future as a Dragon Rider.
